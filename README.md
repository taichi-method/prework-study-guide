 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I'm starting my coding career from zero experience so I needed something to map out my first steps into my new set of skills.
I created the Prework Study Guide webpage because I wanted a one - glance guide with the topics I am going to learn during my bootcamp experience.
By looking at it I can remind myself of the concepts I've learned while implementing the HTML, CSS and Javascript parts of the website and also how to navigate the GitFlow.
I've learned how to lay down the basics of a website using all of those languages and also how to work remotely with GitHub from the terminal.

## Usage

The page is meant to be a simple reminder of what I've learned in the prework activities.
It is divided in sections named after a specific coding language and contains bits of information regarding those; The Javascript elements are not directly visible on the page but can be checked out in Chrome's console. It lists the topics I've dealt with in prework and picks one randomly. Right click on the body of the page, select inspect and then click on the "console" tab to see the output of the JS script.
